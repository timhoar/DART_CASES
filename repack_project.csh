# Script to package yearly files found in $data_proj_space 
# (e.g. /glade/p/nsc/ncis0006/Reanalyses/f.e21.FHIST_BGC.f09_025.CAM6assim.011)
# after repack_st_arch.csh has created them,
# and the matlab scripts have generated the obs space pictures. 
# The resulting files will be moved to 
#   > Campaign Storage for intermediate archiving, 
#     until we want to send them to the RDA.
# This takes time; it actually copies.

# FIXME KEVIN - describe how this is supposed to be run/used.
# >>> Run repack_st_arch.csh before running this script. <<<
# >>> Log in to globus (see mv_to_campaign.csh for instructions).
# >>> From a casper window (but not 'ssh'ed to data-access.ucar.edu)
#     submit this script from the CESM CASEROOT directory. <<<

# > > > WARNING; cheyenne compute nodes do not have access to Campaign Storage. < < < 
#       Run this on casper using slurm.

#-----------------------------------------
# Submitting the job to casper (or other NCAR DAV clusters?) requires using slurm.

# sinfo     information about the whole slurm system
# squeue    information about running jobs
# sbatch    submitting a job
# scancel   killing a job
# scontrol  show job <jobID> specifications 
#           (-d for more details, including the script)
