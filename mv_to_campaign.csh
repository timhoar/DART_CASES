# Script to send output from a CAM+DART assimilation,
# especially the Reanalysis project (2019), to Campaign Storage.
# >>> Before running this script:
#     1) (re)package the files into a directory containing only files to be archived.
#        The final subdirectory is often a CESM style date string; YYYY-MM-DD-SSSSS
#     2) You may need to interactively log in to globus.
#        See https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/storage-and-file-systems/globus-file-transfers
#        for details.
#        But may need to first
#        > ssh data-access.ucar.edu 
#          (alternative: ssh username@data-access.ucar.edu)
#          or open a window on casper.
#        It may be enough to 
#        > module load gnu python
#        > ncar_pylib 20190326
#        OR log in through the globus file manager.
#        In either case:
#        > globus login
#        This seems unnecessary:
#           Copy the resulting URL into your browser
#           Log in there to get the access code.
#           Enter the code into the interactive globus prompt.

# This script was derived from ./mv_to_campaign.sample.csh.
# Documentation of that script is in
